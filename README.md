# IPTea4theStingy

A browser extension for Chromium-based browsers that optimizes your resource management on IPTorrents by analyzing which payment method (bonus points or upload credit) is more efficient for each torrent.

## üîç What It Does

IPTea4theStingy helps you make smarter decisions about resource usage on IPTorrents by:

- Automatically parsing your Current Bonus points and Surplus Upload Credit
- Calculating which payment method uses a smaller percentage of your total resources
- Visually highlighting efficient options with green outlines and inefficient ones with red
- Providing detailed tooltips with percentage calculations
- Displaying a summary of the best options in the extension popup

## üìä How It Works

1. The extension reads your current stats from the page:
   ```
   parachan (Current Bonus: 73610.0) (Surplus Upload Credit: 17.10 TB)
   ```

2. For each torrent with both bonus point and upload credit options, it calculates:
   - What percentage the bonus cost is of your total bonus points
   - What percentage the upload cost is of your total upload credit

3. The option that uses a smaller percentage of your total is highlighted as more efficient.

For example, if using points would cost 1.20% of your total points, but using upload credit would cost 1.26% of your total upload, the extension will recommend using points.
